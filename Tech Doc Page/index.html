                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>
                <p class="mg2">
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements
                    such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by
                    supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="mg2">
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model
                        (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user
                        events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mg2">
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For
                        example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information
                        from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:

                    You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform
                to certain rules.                
                </p>
                <p class="mg2">
                    A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be
                    digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the
                    characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
                </p>
                <p class="mg2">
                    You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences
                    as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

                    You can declare a variable in three ways:
                    <ul>
                        <li class="mg2">
                            With the keyword var. For example,
                            <code class="mg2 cd">var x = 42.</code>
                            This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                        </li>
                        <li class="mg2">
                            By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                            <code class="mg2 cd">x = 42.</code>
                            This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
                        </li>
                        <li class="mg2">
                            With the keyword let. For example,
                            <code class="mg2 cd">let y = 13.</code>
                            This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Scope">
                <header class="heading mg1">
                    <h1>Variable Scope</h1>
                </header>
                <p class="mg2">
                    When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any
                    other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable,
                    because it is available only within that function.
                    <br class="mg2">
                    JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is
                    local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5,
                    because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case
                    is an if statement.
                    <br class="mg2">
                    <code class="mg2 cd">if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code><br class="mg2">
                    This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
                    <br class="mg2">
                    <code class="mg2 cd">if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
                    defined</code>
